    "# Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is basically training a model, known as 'model' to make predictions or generate content using data. We feed it data, and it returns a prediction, it can be categorised as supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, or generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "Labelled data to make predictions, often for regression (predicting numerical values) or classification (categorising data)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "Identiffies patterns in unlabeled data, commonly using clustering to group similar data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generative AI\n",
    "Creates new content such as text, images, or music, by learning patterns from existing data nad mimicking them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine teaching a computer to predict house prices, this is how it would work.\n",
    "1. The data:\n",
    "    Feature ($X$) are like clues or characteristics we use to make predictions, for a house this might be\n",
    "       - size of the house\n",
    "       - number of bedrooms\n",
    "       - location\n",
    "       - age of the house\n",
    "    Target ($y$) are what we're trying to predict (house price)\n",
    "2. Learning process:\n",
    "    Giving the computer a big spreadsheet with lots of houses where we know the features and the selling prices.\n",
    "    The computer looks for pattern in this data, like 'bigger housing costing more' or 'location affecting house prices'\n",
    "4. Training vs Testing:\n",
    "    Think of this studying for a test where;\n",
    "       - training data - practice problems you use to learn\n",
    "       - testing data - exam with new questions\n",
    "    Keep these separate because we want to make sure our model can make good predictions on houses it hasn't seen before, just like a real test/exam.\n",
    "6. Making prediction:\n",
    "    After training, when we show the computer new houses with the features, it uses what it learned to make a prediction about the price."

    "Predicting a number based on other information, e.g. predicing house price (a num) based on size, location, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "Simplest type of prediction model, thinknof it as finding the 'line of best fit' through your data points, it assumes there's a straight-line relationship between input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Regression Example\n",
    "In this example, we will be using linear regression to predict a quantitative measure of diabetes diseases progression based on age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, and sex blood serum measurements s1 to s6 in sklearn's diabetes database."
